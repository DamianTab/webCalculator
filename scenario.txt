# Scenario 1

## Goal
A git repo is successfully created.

## Pre-conditions
- integration-server is up and running

## Main Success Scenario
1. Create dev environment and wait for provisioning process to finish.

## Notes
- It is done in provisioning phase. It is posible to destroy and create new dev env. Then code will be "git clone" instead of init and "git push"


# Scenario 2

## Goal
The pipeline is successfully executed. (in automatic way)

## Pre-conditions
- All environments are up and running without errors in provisioning

## Main Success Scenario
1. Execute
 `sh run.sh start all`
 and wait till process ends.
2. Make changes in dev environment.
3. Execute these:

`git add .
 git commit -m "Some changes"
 git push http://test:12345678@192.168.33.9/gitlab/test/webCalculator.git origin master`

## Notes
- In case of lack of resources it is possible to have up and running only 2 VM -> integration-server + {other}. Then it is necessary to click every step of pipeline in gitlab in order to perform singl step of it. Unfortunately this is manual work.




# Scenario 3

## Goal
Access to the product on production.

## Pre-conditions
- All environments are up and running (to perform automatically deployment and releasing)
or
- prod environment is up and running

## Main Success Scenario
1. Execute
 `sh run.sh start all`
 and wait till process ends.
2. Open http://192.168.33.12:8082 on host machine.


## Notes
- during creation candidate/product only one environment up and running
- run pipeline using gitlab www interface (clicking each step if failed)
